# flock

**let your agents loose.**

[divagation.github.io/flock](https://divagation.github.io/flock/)

flock is a tiny, beautiful macOS app that lets you run as many Claude Code sessions as you want, all at once, all in one window. it also gives you shell panes and editable markdown panes alongside them. watch them think, read, edit, and build in real time. it's like having a team of programmers that never sleeps.

you open flock. you press `⌘T` a few times. suddenly four claudes are working on four different things and you're just... watching. it's kind of mesmerizing honestly.

<br>

## get it

```bash
brew tap divagation/flock
brew install --cask flockapp
```

or grab the `.zip` from [releases](https://github.com/Divagation/flock/releases) and drag it into Applications. done.

<br>

## what you get

🪟 **panes that just work.** they tile themselves. 1 pane fills the screen, 2 panes split in half, 4 make a grid. it figures it out. split horizontal, split vertical, maximize one, whatever you want.

🤖 **agent mode.** this is the fun one. hit `⌘⇧A` and flock becomes a task manager. throw tasks at it, watch them flow across a kanban board (backlog → in progress → done). each agent gets a live timeline showing every file it reads, every edit it makes, every command it runs.

⌨️ **command palette.** `⌘K` opens everything. new panes, markdown files, themes, layouts, broadcast mode. if you've used raycast or arc you already know how this works.

📡 **broadcast mode.** type once, every pane hears it. useful for when you want all your claudes to know something at the same time.

🔍 **find everywhere.** search inside terminal panes or run a global search across every pane, including markdown.

📝 **markdown panes.** open or create markdown files from the command palette, edit them directly in flock, and let them autosave back to disk.

💾 **session restore.** close the app, open it later, everything's still there.

🎨 **themes.** because life's too short for one color scheme.

🔔 **notifications.** flock taps you on the shoulder when an agent finishes something.

🗜️ **wren compression.** toggle on prompt compression and flock runs your messages through [wren](https://github.com/Divagation/wren) before sending, saving tokens automatically. works on paste in terminal mode and message input in agent mode.

## keyboard shortcuts

flock is keyboard-first. your hands never leave the keys.

| | |
|---|---|
| `⌘T` | new claude |
| `⌘⇧T` | new shell |
| `⌘W` | close pane |
| `⌘1`–`⌘9` | jump to pane |
| `⌘←→↑↓` | navigate panes |
| `⌘↩` | maximize / restore |
| `⌘D` | split horizontal |
| `⌘⇧D` | split vertical |
| `⌘K` | command palette |
| `⌘⇧A` | agent mode |
| `⌘⇧B` | broadcast mode |
| `⌘F` | find in terminal pane |
| `⌘⇧F` | find in all panes |

<br>

## build it yourself

you'll need xcode (swift 5.9+).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Divagation/flock.git
cd flock
./build.sh
```

that's it. app goes to `/Applications`, cli goes to `flock`.

<br>

## under the hood

native swift. no electron. terminal panes are powered by [SwiftTerm](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTerm), and markdown panes are native editable text views that autosave to disk. agent mode talks to claude code over `stream-json` and parses every event in real time to build the timelines and kanban board. it's fast because it's not pretending to be a website.

<br>

## why "flock"

a flock of claudes. working together. that's it. that's the name.
